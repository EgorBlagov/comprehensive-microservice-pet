# Ð¡omprehensive Microservice Pet

Here, Dmitry and I will try to build a pet project to learn some technologies widely used in Python Backend Area.
We're planning to try:

- Pydantic
- FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy + Alembic
- Poetry
- Asyncio
- Redis
- Kafka
- PostgreSQL
- Docker + Docker compose

Wow, that's a lot of stuff! Yet a lot a work to be done. We're not going to reinvent the wheel We'll just make a Pastebin clone. Some things are goingto be overcomplicated since we want to try all the techonologies listed.

Hope it's going to be fun.

God bless Dmitry's patience.
